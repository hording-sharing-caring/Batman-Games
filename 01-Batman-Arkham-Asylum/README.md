# Batmanâ„¢: Arkham Asylum Game of the Year Edition

The saves start a bit before croc where the game got stack and I realized that sharing these saves may be valuable for some folks.

Save games are normally located at `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Square Enix\Batman Arkham Asylum GOTY\SaveData\0000000000000000`

Save0.sgd is the first game slot, Save1.sgd is the second etc

Save0 - Copy (3).sgd are various backups I did while playing the game. Rename them to Save0.sgd to restore from there. Save0 - Copy.sgd is right before croc.
